**Project:** Algebraic and AI-Assisted Anomaly Detection for Robotic Sensor Data  
**Schema:** 1.0

## Dataset: lp1

### Best Detectors
- **mahalanobis_d2** — High correlation with other methods (0.93 with pca_hotelling_t2) and moderate mean score (6.0).  
  Numbers: `{"mean": 6.0, "std": 15.25, "corr_to_others": {"PCA_Q": 0.64}}`
- **pca_hotelling_t2** — High correlation with mahalanobis_d2 (0.93) and kpca_recon (0.95).  
  Numbers: `{"mean": 5.0, "std": 12.32, "corr_to_others": {"PCA_Q": 0.3}}`

### Hypotheses
1. 1. Anomalies are related to deviations captured by principal components, as PCA-based methods perform well.
2. 2. Mahalanobis distance effectively captures multivariate outliers due to its high correlation with other methods.
3. 3. Reconstruction errors from autoencoders (ae_recon) are less sensitive to anomalies compared to PCA-based methods.

### Numerical Patterns
- pca_hotelling_t2 has a mean of approximately 5.0 and a standard deviation of 12.32.
- ae_recon has a low mean score (0.0119) compared to other methods.
- Correlations between PCA-based methods (pca_hotelling_t2, kpca_recon) are high (0.95).

### Notes

### Hypotheses
1. 1. Anomalies are strongly related to non-linear relationships in the data, given the high performance and correlation of KPCA.
2. 2. Autoencoder reconstruction errors (ae_recon) are less effective at capturing anomalies compared to kernel-based methods.

- pca_hotelling_t2 and kpca_recon exhibit a very strong correlation (0.99).
- ae_recon has a low mean score (0.063) and relatively low correlation with other methods.
- The mean mahalanobis_d2 is 6.0.

- **kpca_recon** — Very high correlation with pca_hotelling_t2 (0.99).  
  Numbers: `{"mean": 0.82, "std": 6.18, "corr_to_others": {"PCA_Q": 0.26}}`

### Hypotheses

- **kpca_recon** — High correlation with pca_hotelling_t2 (0.98) and high mean (0.88).  
  Numbers: `{"mean": 0.88, "std": 3.75, "corr_to_others": {"PCA_Q": 0.87}}`

### Hypotheses
1. 1. Linear and non-linear relationships are equally important for anomaly detection, as PCA and KPCA perform similarly.

## Cross-Sensor Insights
- pca_hotelling_t2 and mahalanobis_d2 consistently show very high correlation (close to 1.0) across lp4 and lp5, suggesting they capture similar information and one might be redundant.
- kpca_recon consistently shows high correlation with pca_hotelling_t2 across all datasets, indicating that non-linear transformations are important for anomaly detection.
- ae_recon consistently has lower mean scores and lower correlations with other methods compared to PCA-based methods, suggesting it might be less sensitive to anomalies or capture different types of anomalies.
- The mean of mahalanobis_d2 is consistently around 6.0 across all datasets.
- pca_q_residual has a mean close to zero for lp4 and lp5, suggesting that the data in these datasets might be well-explained by the principal components used in the PCA model.

## Industrial Relevance Insights
- High correlation between pca_hotelling_t2 and mahalanobis_d2 suggests that monitoring only one of these metrics could be sufficient, reducing computational overhead in real-time anomaly detection systems.
- The consistent performance of KPCA highlights the importance of capturing non-linear relationships in robotic sensor data, which could be related to complex interactions between different robot joints or environmental factors. Detecting these anomalies early can prevent catastrophic failures.
- The lower sensitivity of ae_recon could be useful for filtering out noise or capturing different types of anomalies, such as subtle drifts in sensor calibration. This can inform predictive maintenance strategies by identifying sensors that require recalibration or replacement.
- Thresholds on pca_hotelling_t2 and kpca_recon can be used to trigger alerts for potential equipment failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.
- The consistently low mean of pca_q_residual in lp4 and lp5 suggests that these datasets might represent a more stable operating regime. Deviations from this baseline could indicate significant anomalies requiring immediate attention.

## General Final Summary
The analysis of anomaly detection methods across multiple robotic sensor datasets reveals that PCA-based methods, particularly Hotelling's T-squared and KPCA reconstruction error, consistently perform well and exhibit high correlations. Mahalanobis distance shows redundancy with Hotelling's T-squared in some datasets. Autoencoders appear less sensitive to anomalies compared to PCA-based approaches. These insights can inform the selection of appropriate anomaly detection techniques for specific robotic systems and guide predictive maintenance strategies by identifying critical sensor metrics and potential failure modes.
