Mahalanobis distance shows redundancy with Hotelling's T-squared in some datasets. Autoencoders appear less sensitive to anomalies compared to PCA-based approaches. These insights can inform the selection of appropriate anomaly detection techniques for specific robotic systems and guide predictive maintenance strategies by identifying critical sensor metrics and potential failure modes."
